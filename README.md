# MinecraftPlayTimeGraph
Generate a GitHub-Like Graph of your Minecraft Playtime

# Creating a Graph
To create a Graph, simply install the needed packages with `pip install`. Then run the program to generate a Graph. If your log-files are stored elsewhere than in `AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/logs`, change the `LOG_DIR` in Line 11. If you want a specific time duration, change `CUTOFF_DATE` in Line 12.
